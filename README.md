# Script of the discipline LEDA

- This repository seeks to guide JAVA students who wish to know the operation of certain data structures and their respective complexity;
- This repository contains the following folders:

## R01-01-Rot-SimpleSorting-Simultaneous-Bubble-environment
- This folder deals with sorting algorithms by comparison:
  * BubbleSort;
  * SelectionSort;
  * InsertionSort;
- The complexity of them revolves around O(nÂ²), and there is no use of auxiliary structures.

## R02-01-Rot-RecursiveSorting-3-way-Quicksort-environment
- This folder deals with recursive sorting algorithms:
  * QuickSort;
  * MergeSort;
- The complexity of them revolves around O(n.log(n)), and there may or may not be the use of auxiliary structures.
